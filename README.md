# EasyFL: 🚀 The first federated learning platform for young people. 🌐

👷: "This project is under construction 🚧."

## Dependency Requirements
1. Python version >= 3.9
2. Torch version >= 2.1

## Installation 
This code is tested on NVIDIA GeForce GTX1660Ti with CUDA 12.3 and 
Intel i7-9750H (12) @ 4.500GHz for `python = 3.9`, `torch = 2.1.2` and
`torchvision=0.16.2`. 

Install all dependencies using the requirements.txt :

```bash
chmod +X ./requirements.sh
./requirements.sh
```

## Running EasyFL
1. Modify the 'config.toml' file in the 'configs' directory based on your requirements. You can use the provided template 'template_config.toml' as a reference. Three preset configurations are available:
    - (CIFAR - 10, MobileNet)
    - (MNIST, LeNet)
    - (CIFAR - 100, ResNet - 18)
2. Customize neural network architectures by defining your own models in the 'models' directory.
3. Run EasyFL on Multi-Progress by the following command:
```bash
python main.py 
```
4. Run EasyFL on Single-Process by the following command:
```python
python single_main.py
```
